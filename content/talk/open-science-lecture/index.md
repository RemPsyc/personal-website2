abstract: Keep hearing about this thing called Open Science, but not quite sure what it is or where to get started? In this 5 part lecture series, I introduce Open Science and some of its elements, including publications, sharing materials, collaborations, and self-corrections. If you use these materials in a course, please let me know!
