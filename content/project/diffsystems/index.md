title: Do bilinguals have separate linguistic systems?
---

Bilinguals have the ability to speak two different languages. How are these languages represented in the mind? Are the rules for each language separated and if so, when and how does this separation develop? This project investigates these questions by tapping into the sound systems of each of a bilinguals' languages. The current focus is on whether or not bilingual toddlers perceive sounds differently depending of what language they're hearing.
